# NYC_Subway_Data_Analysis

## About this Project-:
This is a project about analysing new york city subway data which is in the form of big data.This project is basically categorized into three parts which are-:

1. Data Gathering --> This refers to the gathering of data files from a particular site containing the dataframes.
2. Data Analysis  --> This refers to analysis of data from the file fetched.
3. Map Reduce --> It refers to the efficient way of dealing with the data gathered.

In order to complete this project we need to complete all the exrcises given under these three categories using the python notebook. All these exercises are innovative in themselves and are there with the main motive of teaching new data analysis concepts.

## How to start this project-:
First of all make sure that you are working on the latest version of python that is PYTHON3. In case you dont have that don't worry we can make use of a tool named anaconda which helps us to create any kind of environment and work in that.

1. To download go to the following anaconda website and download the latest version of anaconda software-: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

2. After you download this try installing and configuring it on your machines.

3. After you are done installing this software follow the given below steps.

## How to run your programs-:

1. After installing anaconda successfully try open the terminal or command prompt based on the machines and run the command "jupyter notebook"

2. After running this command our default browser will open displaying the jupyter notebook.

3. Now browse the directories where our python notebook is located and try opening the notebook and even notice the version of python we are using at the top right corner.   

4. if we are using python2 then change it to python 3 by clicking on it and choose python 3 from the list.

5. Now we can create a new file and test our code in this Pyhton3 environment file.

6. In order to execute we can copy the code to a cell in file and press run button on the top bar

## Content inside this python notebook 

The content inside this .py notebook is-:

1. Problem Statements-: These are the statements which contain the problem sets with little bit of hint of solution given in them.

2. Solutions-: These are the areas which contain the solutions of the problems with their meaning stated using the comments.

important: Note-: WHile you solve these problems make sure that you keep the python notebook and data files gathered in one folder only.
